\section{Abstract}
% Goals: Learn more about meshing (in general), Gmsh and MRST
% Develop tools that can be used for further research, or can be used as a starting point for further development
% Introduce new software for combining MRST and Gmsh. While it is not as robust as other options, it showcases how the two modules can be used together, and can be used as a stepping stone for further development
