\section{Combining MRST and Gmsh}
\label{sec:combining}

\subsection{\texttt{GmshToMRST}}
% MATLAB interface for importing Gmsh
% Creates satisfactory MRST grids
% Requires running Gmsh manually

\subsection{\texttt{gmsh2MRST}}
% To handle this ...
% Automatically create Gmsh-meshes from MATLAB
% Abstract most of the heavy lifting

\subsubsection{Features}
% Robust Gmsh meshing
% Complex domains
% Very flexible, many user-settable arguments
% Handles face- and cell constraints
% Can run all meshing- and recombination algorithms Gmsh offer

\subsubsection{Python interface}
% Something about how the Python interface is implemented, how it can be used

\subsubsection{MATLAB interface}
% Something about how the MATLAB interface is implemented, how it can be used

\subsubsection{\texttt{pebiGrid2DGmsh}}
% Base method
% Simply create a Gmsh grid, then load it usin GmshToMRST

\subsubsection{\texttt{clippedPebiGrid2DGmsh}}
% Uses duality of Delaunay and PEBI. Uses the PEBI output from pebiGrid2DGmsh as input to clippedPebiGrid2D. Swaps face- and cell constraints.
% Experimental, limited results, but nicer grids
% Less flexible due to constraint swapping
% Not in Python

\subsubsection{Arguments and defaults}
% Table of arguments
% Python  |  MATLAB  |  Explanation?  |  Default value

\subsubsection{Limitations}
% clippedPebiGrid2DGmsh slow for multiple cell constraints
% Fiddling required to get non-triangular grids (which is Gmsh's default)
% Highly structured cell constraints - may be cases where this is suboptimal
% Face- and cell constraints can NOT cross each other, mesh will not compile!
% Struggles somewhat with crossing face constraints - inaccurate where they overlap

% Likely from GmshToMRST
