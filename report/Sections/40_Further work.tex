\section{Further work}
% TODO: Project is open source, distributed with open licence. Goal is to create the starting point for a usable tool for many, which can be dynamic and driven forward by users
% I have limited knowledge of use and domain, making it hard to ensure the right choices have been made.
% Expanding to 3D mesh generation
% Rewrite to use Gmsh C++ API directly from MATLAB, possibly faster?
