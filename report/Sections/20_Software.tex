\section{Software}
As there exists a vast range of solutions for creating grids to represent real domains, learning, using and discussing all of them are way beyond the scope of this thesis. I will instead focus on two tools - MRST in \autoref{sec:MRST} and Gmsh in \autoref{sec:Gmsh}, as well as ways to combine the two tools in \autoref{sec:combining}.
