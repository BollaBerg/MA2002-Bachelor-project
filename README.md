# MA2002 - Bachelor's project
Work done on my Bachelor's project in Mathematical studies

## Structure
LaTeX files (including, when it gets closer to finishing, the final report) will be in `report/`

Code will be in `code/`

## gmsh4mrst
This is where Python package `gmsh4mrst` started, and all code as of finalizing my thesis is located in `code/gmsh4mrst/`.

Ongoing developments of `gmsh4mrst` will take place in [its own repo](https://github.com/BollaBerg/gmsh4mrst). This is added as a submodule in `code/gmsh4mrst_continued`.
